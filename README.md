# This is a unit selector program writen in python
<br/>
By using this, students of this university called 'Khayyam' can automatically select their units for the upcoming semester.
<br/>
for using this, all you need to do is to have the number of lessons and its group,
<br/>
in this code there are two arrays called 'course' and 'code'
<br/>
by listing the lessons by their numbers, in the same way as the example in the code, and inserting their groups in order in the other array and running it everything's going to be fine and you're going to have a fantastic selection for your next term.
